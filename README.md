# lego_detection_classification

<h4 align="center">A Lego Brick Detection and Classification system developed as the first project for the Image Processing and Vision course. It detects, counts, and classifies rectangular Lego bricks of formats “2x2,” “2x4,” “2x6,” and “2x8,” distinguishing them from other objects, shadows, and overlapping pieces.</h4> 

<h4 align="center">This project was built using <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and the <a href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a> library, leveraging techniques such as image binarization, segmentation, and contour analysis for accurate detection and classification.</h4>
